The following website is build for courswork purposes. CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application was built using Node.js and the Pug view engine. It was created as part of my coursework, so it is a demonstration of my skills and is not intended for production use in any case.

The aim of this website is for task management in different fields. The manager can give a task to employees and set deadline for work they should be doing. Task Name shows the description of what needs to be done. Branch colums is assigned to see what branch the work is going on. For contacting, the employees phone contact is saved for instant calls. Task Owner represents data for those who should actually do the job -> task owner. 

User can also update any information about task when needed. Also delete function is also in use when the manager completes or wants to delete the task from task board. 
To add more tasks, the user can tap on plus button on top-right of the page and create a whole new task from zero. 

Project Structure is as follows
The project is organized into several directories:


Controller: Contains the logic for handling HTTP requests and responses.
Data: Stores any data files needed for the application.
Public: Houses static files such as CSS and JavaScript.
Routes: Defines the routes for both web and API endpoints.
Services: Contains any additional services or utilities needed for the application.
Validators: Holds validation logic to ensure data integrity.
Views: Contains Pug files for rendering the application's views.
